I only wish people knew that : then they wouldn't be so stingy about it , you know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 'She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. ' You're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit . ' ' Perhaps it hasn't one , ' Alice ventured to remark . ' Tut , tut , child ! ' said the Duchess . ' Everything's got a moral , if only you can find it . ' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke . Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the Duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin .
